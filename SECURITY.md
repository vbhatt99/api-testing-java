# Security Configuration

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the API Testing Java project.

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Password Security**
- ‚úÖ **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using BCrypt
- ‚úÖ **Password Exclusion**: Passwords are excluded from API responses using `@JsonIgnore`
- ‚úÖ **Minimum Length**: Password validation requires minimum 6 characters

### 2. **Database Security**
- ‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: Database credentials use environment variables
- ‚úÖ **H2 Console Control**: H2 console access is controlled via environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Default Disabled**: H2 console is disabled by default in production

### 3. **API Security**
- ‚úÖ **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers implemented
- ‚úÖ **CSRF Protection**: CSRF protection configured (disabled for API testing)
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation**: Bean validation on all input fields

### 4. **Logging Security**
- ‚úÖ **Configurable Logging**: Log levels controlled via environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Reduced Debug Info**: Debug logging disabled by default
- ‚úÖ **SQL Logging Control**: Hibernate SQL logging configurable

### 5. **Management Endpoints**
- ‚úÖ **Limited Exposure**: Only health endpoint exposed by default
- ‚úÖ **Authorization Control**: Health details require authorization
- ‚úÖ **Environment Control**: Endpoint exposure configurable

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Headers

The following security headers are automatically added to all responses:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS filtering
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Enforces HTTPS (when enabled)

## üîß Environment Variables

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_USERNAME=sa
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# H2 Console (development only)
H2_CONSOLE_ENABLED=false

# Logging Levels
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
SPRING_WEB_LOG_LEVEL=WARN
HIBERNATE_SQL_LOG_LEVEL=WARN

# Management Endpoints
MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINTS=health
HEALTH_SHOW_DETAILS=when-authorized
```

### Development vs Production

**Development:**
```bash
H2_CONSOLE_ENABLED=true
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINTS=health,info,metrics
```

**Production:**
```bash
H2_CONSOLE_ENABLED=false
LOG_LEVEL=WARN
MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINTS=health
HEALTH_SHOW_DETAILS=never
```

## üö® Security Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

1. **No Authentication**: The application currently allows all requests without authentication
2. **No Rate Limiting**: No protection against API abuse or DDoS attacks
3. **No CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin requests are not properly configured
4. **No API Versioning**: No versioning strategy for API endpoints

### üîÆ Future Security Enhancements

1. **JWT Authentication**: Implement JWT-based authentication
2. **Role-Based Authorization**: Add role-based access control
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
4. **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS configuration for web clients
5. **API Versioning**: Implement API versioning strategy
6. **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive audit logging
7. **Input Sanitization**: Enhanced input sanitization and validation

## üß™ Testing Security

### Security Test Cases

1. **Password Hashing Test**: Verify passwords are properly hashed
2. **API Response Test**: Verify passwords are excluded from responses
3. **Security Headers Test**: Verify all security headers are present
4. **Input Validation Test**: Test various invalid inputs
5. **SQL Injection Test**: Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities

### Running Security Tests

```bash
# Run all tests including security tests
mvn test

# Run specific security test class
mvn test -Dtest=SecurityTest
```

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Production Deployment

- [ ] Change default database password
- [ ] Disable H2 console access
- [ ] Set appropriate log levels
- [ ] Configure HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Implement authentication
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Configure CORS properly
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Perform security penetration testing
- [ ] Review and update dependencies

### Regular Security Maintenance

- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Monitor security advisories
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Perform security scans
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Train team on security best practices

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Disclaimers

### User Responsibility
**By using this project, you acknowledge that:**

- **You are solely responsible** for the security of your deployment
- **The original creator is not liable** for any security incidents or breaches
- **This is educational software** - not production-ready without additional hardening
- **You must implement proper security measures** before any production use
- **Default configurations are for learning only** - never use in production

### Security Incident Response

**If you discover a security issue in your deployment:**

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Assess the severity and impact
   - Take necessary containment measures
   - Document the incident

2. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze logs and evidence
   - Identify root cause
   - Determine scope of impact

3. **Remediation**:
   - Implement fixes
   - Test thoroughly
   - Deploy updates

4. **Post-Incident**:
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security measures
   - Improve monitoring

**Note**: The original creator is not responsible for security incidents in your deployment.

## üìû Security Contact

For security-related questions or to report vulnerabilities in the original project:

- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues with "security" label
- **Documentation**: Refer to this SECURITY.md file
- **For your deployment**: You are responsible for your own security
