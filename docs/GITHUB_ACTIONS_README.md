# GitHub Actions: Automated API Test Workflow

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically run API tests using Maven and JUnit.

## Workflow Details

- **Location:** `.github/workflows/api-tests.yml`
- **Triggers:**
  - On every push to `main` and `first-api-branch`
  - Every Friday at midnight (UTC)

## How It Works

1. **Checkout code:** Uses the latest code from the repository.
2. **Set up JDK 17:** Ensures the correct Java version is used for testing.
3. **Cache Maven packages:** Speeds up builds by caching dependencies.

4. **Build and test:** Runs `mvn clean test` with secure environment variables to execute all tests.
5. **Upload Allure Results:** After tests, the workflow uploads the `allure-results` directory as an artifact for download and review.

## Environment Variables

The workflow now includes secure environment variables for testing:

```yaml
env:
  # Database Configuration
  DB_USERNAME: sa
  DB_PASSWORD: ci_test_password_123
  # H2 Console Configuration (disabled for CI)
  H2_CONSOLE_ENABLED: false
  # Logging Configuration
  LOG_LEVEL: INFO
  SPRING_WEB_LOG_LEVEL: WARN
  HIBERNATE_SQL_LOG_LEVEL: WARN
  HIBERNATE_BINDER_LOG_LEVEL: WARN
  # Management Endpoints Configuration
  MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINTS: health
  HEALTH_SHOW_DETAILS: when-authorized
```

These variables ensure secure configuration and proper test execution in the CI environment.

## Test Reports

After each run:

- **Artifacts:** Allure results (`allure-results`) and the generated HTML report (`allure-report`) are available as downloadable workflow artifacts in the GitHub Actions run summary.
- **Online Viewing:** The workflow automatically deploys the latest Allure HTML report to GitHub Pages (`gh-pages` branch). Only the most recent report is available online, and it is overwritten with each run.

### How to View the Latest Allure Report Online

1. Go to your repositoryâ€™s **Settings > Pages**.
2. Set the source branch to `gh-pages` and folder to `/` (root).
3. Save the settings. GitHub will provide a public URL (e.g., `https://<your-username>.github.io/api-testing-java/`).
4. Open the URL in your browser to view the latest Allure report.

> **Note:** The report is public if your repository is public. Review your test results for sensitive information before publishing.

- To change the schedule, edit the `cron` value in `.github/workflows/api-tests.yml`.
- To add more branches or steps, update the workflow file as needed.
